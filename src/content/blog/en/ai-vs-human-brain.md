In recent years, neural networks have kicked the door open into our lives. From generating crazy images to writing complex code — Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now everywhere. But does this mean it's time for us to relax and let algorithms think for us? Spoiler: no. Let's figure out when to hand the wheel to the machine, and when it's better to hold it firmly with your own hands.

## When it's better to use neural networks

Neural networks are your ideal intern: fast, diligent, but without a spark of divine wrath.

### 1. Routine that kills
Need to write a boring email, create a structure for a report, or format a crooked table? Give it to the neural network. It won't roll its eyes and will do everything in seconds. Free your brain for what is truly important.

### 2. Digesting gigabytes
Our brain is a cool thing, but it can't keep thousands of parameters in mind simultaneously. Neural networks crack big data like nuts. Find a pattern in the chaos of numbers? Easy.

### 3. Cure for the "blank page"
Sitting in front of an empty screen and don't know where to start? Ask AI to throw in 10 ideas. Most likely, 8 of them will be trash, but the remaining 2 might ignite a spark in you. Use AI as a springboard, not as an elevator.

### 4. Google on steroids
Instead of opening 50 tabs, ask the neural network to explain a complex topic "in simple terms". This will save a ton of time. (Just for god's sake, check the facts, they love to lie!)

## When you need to turn on your brain

AI is a calculator of words and pixels. It has no soul, conscience, or life experience.

### 1. Responsible decisions
The machine can offer options, but the choice is your responsibility. Ethical dilemmas, complex life choices, or business strategies require intuition, morality, and understanding of context. The neural network doesn't have this and never will.

### 2. Lie detector and critical thinking
Neural networks "hallucinate" so confidently that any politician would be envious. Never copy answers blindly. Your skepticism and ability to verify information are what save you from fatal mistakes.

### 3. Soul and emotions
AI can imitate Hemingway's style, but it has never felt the pain of loss or the joy of first love. Art that touches is born from human experience. If you want the text or design to "breathe", put yourself into it.

## Where have neural networks already beaten us?

Let's be honest, in some things we are hopelessly behind:

*   **Speed:** What you will toil over for half a day, AI will do while you blink.
*   **Endurance:** They don't get headaches, don't have burnout, and don't need coffee. 24/7 pure productivity.
*   **Erudition:** They have "read" the entire internet. Superficially, but still.

## How to make AI your mentor, not a substitute

The biggest mistake is asking the neural network to "do everything for me". This is the path to degradation. The right approach is to use AI as a mentor or sparring partner.

### 1. "Explain, don't solve"
Instead of "write me code for this function", ask: *"Explain how best to design this function, and what patterns would fit here"*. This way you upgrade your skills, not just copy-paste.

### 2. Criticism and improvement
Wrote text or code? Feed it to the neural network with the request: *"Criticize this. What can be improved? Where are the weak points?"*. A look from the outside (even a digital one) helps to see mistakes that a blurred eye misses.

### 3. Socratic dialogue
Use AI for brainstorming. Argue with it. Ask it to find counterarguments to your idea. This forces your brain to work more actively, honing your own thoughts against the "wall" of the algorithm.

## Conclusion

Neural networks are not a replacement for the brain, but an exoskeleton for the mind. They make us more powerful if we know how to control them. Don't let the tool become the master. Use AI to get rid of boredom and learn faster, but keep the steering wheel, pedals, and map to yourself. The future belongs to those who know how to dance with algorithms without stepping on their feet.
